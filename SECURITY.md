# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

This repository contains the configuration for a home Kubernetes infrastructure. While it's designed for personal use, security is taken seriously to protect both the infrastructure and serve as a good example for others.

## üîí Security Measures

### Secrets Management
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets are managed via 1Password and External Secrets Operator
- **Secret Rotation**: Secrets are rotated regularly through 1Password
- **Least Privilege**: Applications only have access to secrets they need

### Container Security
- **Non-Root Containers**: Most containers run as non-root users
- **Read-Only Filesystems**: Where possible, containers use read-only root filesystems
- **Security Contexts**: Proper security contexts are applied to drop capabilities
- **Image Scanning**: Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities via Renovate

### Network Security
- **Network Policies**: Implemented where appropriate to segment traffic
- **TLS Everywhere**: All external traffic uses TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt
- **Private Networks**: Internal services are not exposed to the internet unless necessary
- **VPN Access**: Remote access is provided via Tailscale VPN

### Access Control
- **RBAC**: Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control is properly configured
- **Service Accounts**: Applications use dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions
- **Authentication**: SSO is provided via Authentik for applicable services
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained permissions are applied throughout

### Infrastructure Security
- **Immutable OS**: Talos Linux provides an immutable, secure operating system
- **Secure Boot**: Enabled on supported hardware
- **Encrypted Storage**: Storage is encrypted at rest
- **Regular Updates**: Automated updates via System Upgrade Controller

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### For Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability in this infrastructure setup, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email** security concerns to: [security contact would go here]
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Allow** reasonable time for investigation and fixes

### For General Security Improvements
For general security improvements or best practices:
- Create a GitHub issue with the `security` label
- Submit a pull request with security enhancements
- Discuss in GitHub Discussions for broader security topics

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Scanning
This repository includes automated security scanning:
- **Dependency Scanning**: Renovate checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Container Scanning**: Images are scanned for known vulnerabilities
- **Configuration Scanning**: YAML files are validated for security best practices
- **Secret Scanning**: GitHub's secret scanning prevents accidental secret commits

### Manual Security Reviews
Regular security reviews include:
- **RBAC Audits**: Reviewing service account permissions
- **Network Policy Reviews**: Ensuring proper network segmentation
- **Secret Management Audits**: Verifying secret rotation and access
- **Container Security Reviews**: Checking for privilege escalation

## üìã Security Checklist

### For Contributors
When contributing to this repository, ensure:

- [ ] **No secrets** in YAML files or commit history
- [ ] **Proper RBAC** permissions for new services
- [ ] **Security contexts** applied to containers
- [ ] **Network policies** considered for new applications
- [ ] **Schema validation** passes for all YAML files
- [ ] **Least privilege** principle followed

### For New Applications
When adding new applications:

- [ ] **Security context** configured (non-root, read-only filesystem)
- [ ] **Resource limits** set to prevent resource exhaustion
- [ ] **Network policies** defined if needed
- [ ] **Secrets** managed via External Secrets Operator
- [ ] **RBAC** permissions minimized
- [ ] **Container image** from trusted source and regularly updated

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools

### Validation Scripts
Use the included security validation tools:

```bash
# Check for common security issues
python3 scripts/validate-security.py

# Validate RBAC configurations
python3 scripts/validate-rbac.py

# Check for hardcoded secrets (if implemented)
python3 scripts/scan-secrets.py
```

### External Tools
Recommended external security tools:
- **Falco**: Runtime security monitoring
- **OPA Gatekeeper**: Policy enforcement
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanning
- **Kube-bench**: CIS Kubernetes benchmark

## üîÑ Security Updates

### Automated Updates
- **Renovate**: Automatically updates dependencies and container images
- **System Upgrade Controller**: Handles OS and Kubernetes updates
- **Flux**: Automatically applies security patches from this repository

### Manual Updates
For critical security updates:
1. **Assess Impact**: Understand the scope of the vulnerability
2. **Test Changes**: Validate fixes in a staging environment
3. **Deploy Quickly**: Apply critical security patches promptly
4. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues after deployment
